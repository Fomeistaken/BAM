# BAM!

BAM! is a free educational website with courses for everyone.

It is built using React.js and uses Supabase as its backend. The Youtube API is also used because I am still learning about supabase and I am not so skilled, I soon will add a video upload feature removing the need of the Youtube API.

This project is inspired by [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), the greatly inspired me to make education free for everyone, everywhere. That's why I made this website.
